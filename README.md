## Introduction

In this project, we explore the application of SQL for healthcare data analysis. The provided SQL scripts showcase how to manipulate and retrieve data, perform aggregations, and gain insights from a healthcare-related database.

## SQL Concepts

The project covers the following SQL concepts:

- Database creation and management
- Table creation and modification
- SQL queries, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements
- Joins, subqueries, CTE and aggregations

Each concept is demonstrated with relevant examples and explanations in the provided SQL scripts.

## Python Connector and Data Loading

This project also includes a Python connector to the SQL server and demonstrates how to load data from a .sql file using the `pyodbc` library. The connector code will be found in ipynb file

## Usage

To use this project, you'll need access to a SQL database and a SQL client. Follow these steps:

1. Set up a SQL database and create the required tables based on the provided schema.
2. Execute the SQL scripts in the given order to populate the tables and perform data analysis.
3. Modify the scripts as needed to adapt to your specific database structure and requirements.
4. Review the results and insights obtained from the executed SQL queries.

## Examples

To illustrate the usage of SQL concepts, the project includes examples such as:

- Retrieving patient information and medical records
- Calculating average patient age
- Finding the most common medical conditions
- Identifying patients with multiple diagnoses
- Analyzing patient demographics by region
- Aggregating medication usage statistics

These examples provide a glimpse into how SQL can be leveraged to extract valuable insights from healthcare data.
